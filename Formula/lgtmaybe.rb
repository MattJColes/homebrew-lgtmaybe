    # and litellm >= 1.92, which ships only manylinux wheels) whose sdists
    # cannot build inside Homebrew's sandbox (no Cargo), so install lgtmaybe
    # and its dependencies from upstream PyPI wheels into an isolated
    # virtualenv. --prefer-binary makes pip back off to the newest version
    # that has a macOS-compatible wheel instead of grabbing a newer sdist it
    # would then fail to compile. The venv is created plainly so ensurepip
    # provides pip.
